  mat - A simple binary matrix file format

A very simple file format for the storage and access of rectangular 2D double
matrices.

A matfile consists of a short header section, and then data. All multi-byte
values are stored in little endian format. The header has the following
structure:

| Field     | Length in bytes | Description                |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------------------|
| fileid    | 2 (uint16_t)    | matfile identifier         |
| nrows     | 8 (uint64_t)    | number of rows             |
| ncols     | 8 (uint64_t)    | number of columns          |
| flags     | 2 (uint16_t)    | flags                      |
| hdrsize   | 2 (uint16_t)    | header data size           |
| labelsize | 1 (uint8_t)     | size of one label in bytes |
| hdrdata   | hdrsize         | header data                |

The data has the following structure (this structure varies depending on
the values of certain flags; see below):

| Field     | Length in bytes          | Description           |
|-----------|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| rowlabels | nrows*labelsize          | Label for each row    |
| collabels | ncols*labelsize          | Label for each column |
| data      | nrows*ncols*8 (double)   | Matrix data           |

Each value in the matrix is stored as an IEEE 754 double precision floating
point value (8 bytes). The data is stored row-wise. i.e.  for a matrix of size
n*m (n rows, m columns), the first row of the matrix is stored in bytes
0-(n-1) of the data section, the second row is stored in bytes n-(2n-1), and
so on.

A few flags specify deviations in the file format specified above:

| Bit | Name     | Meaning                |
|-----|----------|------------------------|
| 0   | sym      | Is matrix symmetric?   |
| 1   | rowlabel | Are rowlabels present? |
| 2   | collabel | Are collabels present? |

If the sym flag is set (==1), the file is assumed to contain a square n*n
matrix which is symmetric along the diagonal. In this case, only the upper
right triangle of the matrix is stored. The first row of the matrix takes up
bytes 0-(n-1), the second row n-(2n-2), the ith row 0-(in-i-1), and the nth
row takes up a single byte (n-1). Writes and queries into the lower left half
of the matrix are translated into the upper right half.

If the rowlabel flag is set, a list of label fields, one for each row,
immediately follows the header section. If the rowlabel flag is clear, this
section is not present. The same applies for the collabel flag and
section. Anything may be stored in label sections - the format and byte order
is not specified.
