Various utilities for working with NGDB graph files and ANALYZE75 image files.

  avgimg     - Average a collection of ANALYZE75 image files (the inputs 
               must have the same dimensions).

               number of inputs.
  catimg     - Concatenate a collection of ANALYZE75 image files into a 
               volume (the inputs must have the same dimensions).
  cdot       - Convert a ngdb graph to a graphviz dot file.
  ceo        - Convert a radatools lol file to a ngdb graph file.
  cedgenorm  - Normalise edge weights in a ngdb graph file.
  cextract   - Extract subgraphs by label.
  cgen       - Generate graphs of different types.
  cmask      - Mask the nodes of a ngdb file with the values from a 
               corresponding ANALYZE75 image file.
  cmerge     - Merge nodes by label.
